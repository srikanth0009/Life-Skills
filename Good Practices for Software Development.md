# Good Practices for Software Development
### 1.Which point(s) were new to you?
* We recommend tracking your time using app like Boosted to improve productivity.
* The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. You need to make it very easy for the person to answer your question. Messages like the database is not connecting, need your help or the build is not working, can you help me out, will not get you the answers you are looking for.
* In meetings, keep your video turned on. It will improve the rapport with your team and help improve communication.
* Make notes while discussing requirements with your team.
### 2.Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
* Gathering requirements
  - I will try to make notes while discussing requirements with your team.
* Stuck? Ask questions
  - The way ask a question impacts the response, so I try to convey them very easily.
