# Prevention of Sexual Harassement
## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
* Asking about a person’s relationships, sexual preferences.
* To tell about one’s own sexual experiences in a way that makes others persons uncomfortable.
* Bullying someone to agree sexual advances or favors.
* Gossiping someone’s sexual or romantic life in a way that damages their reputation.
* Touching, patting, pinching, hugging, intentionally brushing up against someone without their permission.
* Comments about a person’s body, appearance, or personal life in a sexual or suggestive manner.
* Offering benefits, promotions, or other advantages in exchange for sexual favors.
## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
### Immediate Safety
* If I feel threatened or uncomfortable, I would be to remove myself from the situation. I’d make sure to get to a safe space and reach out to someone I trust for support.
* If I saw someone else in distress, I would assess the situation. If safe, I’d either try to defuse it by interrupting or offering to accompany the person to a safer location.
### Document the Incident
* Take detailed notes about what happened, including who was involved, the time, place, and specific behaviors or words used. If it’s an ongoing pattern, I’d document each incident as it occurs.
* As a witness, I’d note my observations objectively and be prepared to share them if asked.
### Seek Support
* Facing or witnessing harassment can be emotionally draining. I would consider talking to a friend, family, counselor, or therapist for support and advice.
### Consult External Resources if Necessary
* If internal reporting didn’t work properly, I would look into external options. This might involve consulting a legal professional or contacting an agency like the EEOC or a similar authority depending on my location.
